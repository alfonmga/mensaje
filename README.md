# Mensaje

Mensaje is an app to slow down the Slack pace.

Mensaje allows you to write long, more thoughtful posts and share them with your team in Slack without worrying about messages getting lost in the Slack jungle of messages.

Currently, the tool tries to replace internal emails and communications but moving forward. It should also serve as a place to have slow-paced discussions, which Slacks is terrible at.

## Motivation

Working remote has clear advantages but also proposes new challenges. Slow-paced communications are one of them. People tend to discuss, argue, and collaborate over chat, and this generates poor results. Chats are not suitable for thinking or debating. Almost everything that's decided over chat is poorly analyzed and discussed.
